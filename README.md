# less2cssUI

## Getting Started

* Populate the styles.less file with less code.
or
* change where he less code can be found by updating `const lessFilePath...` in lessToCss.html (this includes if it is named differently.)

## TODO

* [ ] No longer require an HTTP server (reference LESS file data without any APIs)
